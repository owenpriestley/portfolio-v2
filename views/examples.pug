      h2 Managing permissions in DLM Dashboard
      p I joined the DLM Dashboard product team as their user base started to grow rapidly.
      p Following #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://redgate.uservoice.com/forums/256011-dlm-dashboard") feedback from UserVoice], the team started work on user roles and different levels of permissions.
      p I was tasked with designing the onboarding journey for new users, or existing users who wanted to request extra permissions. 
      p I also wrote #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://documentation.red-gate.com/ddb1/managing-users-and-permissions") the documentation] to support users and administrators through the process.

      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; font-size: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1%;") New users who joined a team with restricted access needed an easy way to contact their administrator. I designed a journey that worked both in-app and via email.

      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; font-size: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1%;") Once new users had access to the app, they needed somewhere to view their current permissions and request new ones. Working with a UX designer, I helped build and test this interface with users.
      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; font-size: 1.5rem;") User focused language helps people understand what they can and can't do in the app, and makes it clear how to request individual and bulk permissions.

      h2 Reactive advice for Windrush citizens
      p In the wake of the Windrush scandal, affected citizens were left helpless. 
      p With #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/710576/The_Windrush_Scheme.pdf") a lengthy PDF document buried on the Home Office website] the only available guidance, Citizens Advice saw a sudden spike in the number of cases surrounding immigration - both online and in person.
      p We needed to offer reassurance and guidance to those affected, without causing panic or unnecessary stress.
      p Working to a very tight deadline, I paired with immigration experts to write clear, concise and actionable advice content using the Citizens Advice tone of voice.

      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; color: red; font-size: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1%;") This PDF is far from mobile friendly, and mentions forms without giving any direct links. The language is passive, vague and officious.

      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; color: green; font-size: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1%")  The Citizens Advice tone of voice is friendly yet authoritative. I used this to offer concrete next steps to those affected. 
      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; color: green; font-size: 1.5rem") Short, actionable paragraphs and concise bullet points keep the content accessible on mobile - a platform most of our users are on.

        p In the week before we published this advice content, we saw:
          ul
            li 10% spike in traffic to our immigration content
            li sudden demand on local offices for immigration advice
            li queries and complaints about the lack of advice
        p After publication, traffic to the general immigration pages decreased as people found what they needed on this page. 
        p We continued to track clickthroughs the main CTA on the page - directing users to the the right contact channels - and monitored feedback.

      h2 Getting access to priority services
      p To help vulnerable people access free services they were entitled to, my team was tasked with designing a user centered onboarding process. 
      p I used microcopy that uses a friendly, approachable tone of voice and plain English to build trust with users.

      p.img-sub(style="max-width: 90%; color: red; font-size: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1%;") There's no explanation why people need to give this information, and the language is dense and impersonal.

        p Testing this new journey showed that using more relatable language and logical groupings saw around:
          ul 
            li 30% more people reaching the end of the journey
            li 20% fewer people selecting things that didn't apply to them
        p The progressive disclosure of criteria slowed down the completion time, but increased the accuracy of results considerably.
