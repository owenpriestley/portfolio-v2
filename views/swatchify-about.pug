      h2 What the heck is Swatchify?
      p I wanted to learn how to build web applications in Node.JS - a popular javascript library. At the same time, I wanted do something involving music and art. 
      p So I built a web app that takes a song, artist or album, and generates out a colour scheme to match. Let's face it - the possibilities are basically endless!
      a.case-study(href="/projects/swatchify" style="float: left") Try it out â†’

          p Any song, any artist - anything on Spotify!

      h2 How it works
      p When you enter an artist, song or album title, Swatchify calls on #[a(href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/") the Spotify API] to grab album artwork for the first result.
      p Behind the scenes, #[a(href="https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/") node-vibrant] parses the image and picks out the most prominent 6 colours. 
      p Swatchify then renders the colours as a handy palette on the right-hand side of the page.

            p Adopting Lean UX principles helped keep the focus on our users during alpha and beta stages.

      h2 What's next
      p As I build on my existing knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, I'd like to:
      ul  
        li improve the experience on mobile
        li support more than just the first result on Spotify
        li work in reverse - input colours, get music!
