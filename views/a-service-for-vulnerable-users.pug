      h1 12 million vulnerable people are eligible for free, specialised support from their energy supplier.

      h2 My role
      p I led content strategy for the team tasked with designing a universal, accessible and user centred service to reach eligible people who aren't signed up.
      p In practice, this involved
      ul
        li using Lean methodology to understand our users
        li designing an MVP service
        li wire framing complex journeys for a dual audience
        li designing flat content to support users

      h2 The problem
      p A large portion of people who are eligible for extra support aren't confident using the internet and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Existing forms are complex, long-winded and usually buried several levels deep on corporate websites.

      h2 Record assumptions, hypotheses and validation signals
      p To get to grips with the problem, I started the project by getting the team together to record their assumptions about users and how they might interact with the service.
      p Attaching hypotheses make their impact on the solution concrete, and validation signals help shape discussion guides in user research and testing.

      h2 Design the MVP
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was unclear, jargon-filled and and outdated. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form
      p I tracked clickthrough rates on the form finder for each network, and targeted some users with an intercept survey to gather potential research participants.

      h2 Wireframe complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles], and #[a(href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php") the question protocol], I worked with a UX designer to build and test a more complex interactive prototype.
      p This testing exposed more complexities, particularly for 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf.
      p The language and tone of voice needed to change significantly depending who's filling in the form. I created a detailed journey map to define a consistent tone-of-voice for each journey.
