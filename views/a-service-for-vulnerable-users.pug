      h2 The problem
      p Through research, we knew that many eligible people have little confidence in using online services.
      p Each energy supplier has their own onboarding process. These are often long, complex forms buried deep on corporate websites.
      p Not everyone is eligible, and a large part of the journey is selecting very personal criteria that qualify you.

            p Even if users could find the right form, they found it difficult to fill in.

      h2 What we did
      p I worked with a user researcher and UX designer to design an accessible onboarding process rooted in user needs.
      p Our main goals were to reduce the number of people filling in the form inaccurately, and get more people to the end of the journey.
      p A large part of this was to build trust with our users through clear, concise and useful language.

      h2 Starting with user needs
      p We tested some existing journeys with users and found that selecting personal characteristics was a key pain point. 
      p At this point in the journey they felt:
      ul
        li mistrust
        li skepticism
        li reluctance to continue
      p We also found 40% of users were selecting options that didn't apply to them - or missing out on things that did - because they didn't understand the questions.
      p I set out to use language that could support users through this difficult, intrusive journey.

          p People felt little confidence or trust in the process. And they had lots of questions.

      h2 Speaking our users' language
      p 
      p Testing showed that users were overwhelmed by the long list of criteria and confused by the lack of context. 
      p They didn't understand why we needed data we asked for, and the forms used impersonal language users found hard to relate to.
      p To build a more relatable journey and build trust with users I:
      ul
        li arranged a card sort to group the long list into logical categories
        li talked to users about their personal needs and how they would describe them
        li worked with experts to provide context to some of the criteria

        p Testing our new approach showed that using more relatable language and logical groupings saw around:
          ul 
            li 30% more people reaching the end of the journey
            li 20% fewer people selecting things that didn't apply to them
        p The progressive disclosure of criteria slowed down the completion time, but increased the accuracy of results considerably.

      h2 Testing out hypotheses
      p But to build a complete service, we needed to record assumptions about all the people who might use it, and pain points they might have.
      p We attached hypotheses to make the impact on the solution clear, and defined validation signals to help guide future conversations with users.
      p But to turn them into user needs, we first needed to validate our hypotheses through research and testing.

      h2 Writing for the third person
      p Following #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles] and the question protocol, I worked with a UX designer to build and test an interactive prototype of the complete service.
      p This showed that 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf - found it difficult to identify with the language.
      p How we addressed the user needed to change depending on who filled in the form, and who they were filling it in for. This was the first time I'd come across a use case for third-person language.
      p I created a  journey map to define the language for each user and their respective journey, while maintaining a consistent tone of voice.

      h2 Quick win: building the MVP
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was lengthy and out of date. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form for their energy supplier
      p Tracking clickthrough rates on the form finder gave us an indication of how engaged users were with this content as a whole. 
      p We used these findings to build our case for taking ownership of the full onboarding journey.
