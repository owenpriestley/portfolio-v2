      h2 My role
      p We needed to reach these eligible people and help them sign up for free support.
      p I worked with a user researcher and a UX designer to build a universal, accessible and user centred service.
      p In practice, this involved:
      ul
        li validating hypotheses about our users through data and research
        li wireframing the journey for different users and scenarious
        li writing UX copy with empathy and trust

      h2 The problem
      p Through research, we knew that many eligible users aren't confident using the internet, and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Each energy supplier has their own form - these are often complex, long-winded and buried on corporate websites.
      p We set out to design a straightforward, accessible onbording process - with language our users could understand.

      h2 Identifying user needs
      p To understand our users and the problems they faced, we recorded assumptions about who might use this new service and pain points they might have.
      p We attached hypotheses to make the impact on the solution clear, and defined validation signals to help guide future conversations with users.
      p To turn them into user needs, we first needed to validate our hypotheses through research and testing.

      h2 Speaking our users' language
      p Existing sign up processes asked for lots of personal and often sensitive information.
      p After speaking to users, we found they were overwhelmed by the long list of criteria and confused by the lack of context. The language was also impersonal and hard to relate to.
      p Following a card sorting exercise, I worked with a UX designer to redesign the journey and rewrite the copy - using plain English and brand tone of voice.

      h2 Wireframing complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles] and 'the question protocol', I worked with a UX designer to build and test an interactive prototype.
      p This testing showed that 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf - found it difficult to identify with the language.
      p How we addressed the user needed to change depending on who filled in the form, and who they were filling it in for.
      p I created a  journey map to define the language for each user and their respective journey, while maintaining a consistent tone of voice.

      h2 Quick win: building the MVP
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was lengthy and out of date. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form for their energy supplier
      p Tracking clickthrough rates on the form finder gave us an indication of how engaged users were with this content as a whole. 
      p We used these findings to build our case for taking ownership of the full onboarding journey.
