      h1 12 million vulnerable people are eligible for free, specialised support from their energy supplier.

      h2 My role
      p I worked with a user researcher and a UX designer to build a universal, accessible and user centred service to reach eligible people who aren't signed up.
      p In practice, this involved:
      ul
        li using Lean methodology to understand our users
        li wireframing the journey for different scenarios
        li writing UX copy for a dual audience

      h2 The problem
      p Many people people who are eligible for extra support aren't confident using the internet, and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Each energy supplier has their own forms - often complex, long-winded and buried on corporate websites.
      p We needed to design a straightforward, accessible onbording process and host it in a central place.

      h2 Identifying user needs
      p To grips with the problem and understand our users, the team recorded their assumptions about who might use this new service, and pain points they might have.
      p We attached hypotheses to make the impact on the solution clear, and defined validation signals to shape our research discussion guides.

      h2 Wireframing complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles] and 'the question protocol', I worked with a UX designer to build and test an interactive prototype.
      p It was especially tricky to onboard 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf.
      p We needed to use different language depending on who filled in the form, and who they were filling it in for.
      p I designed a detailed journey map to define a consistent tone of voice for each user and their respective journey.

      h2 Building the minimum viable product
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was unclear, jargon-filled and and outdated. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form
      p I tracked clickthrough rates on the form finder for each network, and targeted some users with an intercept survey to gather potential research participants.
