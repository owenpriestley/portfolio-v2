      h2 My role
      p We needed to reach eligible people who aren't signed up for free support, and make the process as easy as possible. 
      p I worked with a user researcher and a UX designer to build a universal, accessible and user centred service.
      p In practice, this involved:
      ul
        li using Lean methodology to understand our users
        li wireframing the journey for different scenarios
        li writing UX copy for a dual audience

      h2 The problem
      p Many people who are eligible for extra support aren't confident using the internet, and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Each energy supplier has their own forms - often complex, long-winded and buried on corporate websites.
      p We needed to design a straightforward, accessible onbording process - with language our users could understand.

      h2 Identifying user needs
      p To understand our users and the problem, we recorded assumptions about who might use this new service and pain points they might have.
      p We attached hypotheses to make the impact on the solution clear, and defined validation signals to help guide discussions with users.
      p To create user needs, we first backed up all of our hypotheses with evidence through research and testing.

      h2 Speaking our users' language
      p Existing sign up processes asked for lots of personal and often sensitive information.
      p After speaking to users, we found they were overwhelmed by the long list of criteria and confused by the lack of context. The language was also impersonal and hard to relate to.
      p Following a card sorting exercise, I worked with a UX designer to redesign the journey and rewrite the copy - using plain English and brand tone of voice.

      h2 Wireframing complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(style="font-weight: normal" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles] and 'the question protocol', I worked with a UX designer to build and test an interactive prototype.
      p It was especially tricky to onboard 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf.
      p We needed to use different language depending on who filled in the form, and who they were filling it in for.
      p I designed a detailed journey map to define a consistent tone of voice for each user and their respective journey.

      h2 Building the minimum viable product
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was unclear, jargon-filled and and outdated. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form
      p I tracked clickthrough rates on the form finder for each network, and targeted some users with an intercept survey to gather potential research participants.
