      h2 My role
      p I worked with a user researcher and a UX designer to build a universal, accessible and user centred service to reach eligible people who aren't signed up.
      p In practice, this involved:
      ul
        li using Lean methodology to understand our users
        li wireframing the journey for different scenarios
        li writing UX copy for a dual audience

      h2 The problem
      p Many people people who are eligible to sign up for extra support aren't confident using the internet, and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Existing processes are complex, long-winded and usually buried several levels deep on corporate websites.
      p We needed to design a straightforward, accessible onbording process for these people.

      h2 Identify our user needs
      p I kicked off the project by asking the team to record their assumptions about who our users are, and how they might interact with the service. This helped us get to grips with the problem.
      p We attached hypotheses to make the impact on the solution concrete, and used validation signals to shape discussion guides in user research and testing.

      h2 Wireframing complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles] and 'the question protocol', I worked with a UX designer to build and test an interactive prototype.
      p It was especially tricky to onboard 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf.
      p We needed to use different language and tone-of-voice depending on who filled in the form, and who they care for.
      p I created a detailed journey map to define a consistent tone-of-voice for each user and their journey.

      h2 Building the minimum viable product
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was unclear, jargon-filled and and outdated. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form
      p I tracked clickthrough rates on the form finder for each network, and targeted some users with an intercept survey to gather potential research participants.
