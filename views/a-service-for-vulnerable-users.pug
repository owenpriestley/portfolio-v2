      h1 12 million vulnerable people are eligible for free, specialised support from their energy supplier.

      h2 My role
      p I led content strategy for the team tasked with designing a universal, accessible and user centred service to reach eligible people who aren't signed up.
      p In practice, this involved
      ul
        li using Lean methodology to understand our users
        li designing an MVP service
        li wire framing complex journeys for a dual audience
        li designing flat content to support users

      h2 The problem
      p Lots of people people could sign up for extra support aren't confident using the internet, and find long forms difficult to fill in.
      p Existing forms are complex, long-winded and usually buried several levels deep on corporate websites.

      h2 Record assumptions, hypotheses and validation signals
      p I kicked off the project by asking the team to record their assumptions about who our users are, and how they might interact with the service. This helped us get to grips with the problem.
      p We attaches hypotheses to make the impact on the solution concrete, and used validation signals to shape discussion guides in user research and testing.

      h2 The minimum viable product
      p The existing Citizens Advice content on priority services ranked highly on Google - but it was unclear, jargon-filled and and outdated. As a quick-win, I redesigned the content on the site to:
      ul
        li make the journey clearer
        li distil eligibility criteria into actionable bullets
        li include a simple form-finder that points users to the right form
      p I tracked clickthrough rates on the form finder for each network, and targeted some users with an intercept survey to gather potential research participants.

      h2 Wireframe complex parts of the journey
      p Following #[a(href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/") GDS design principles], and #[a(href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php") the question protocol], I worked with a UX designer to build and test a more complex interactive prototype.
      p This testing found more complexities, particularly for 'proxy users' - those filling in the form on someone else's behalf.
      p We needed to use different language and tone-of-voice depending on who filled in the form. I created a detailed journey map to define a consistent tone-of-voice for each journey.
